&lt;p&gt;Primarily I have worked with numeric and text data. I wanted to get to grips with working with different data sorts, and especially messy data. With this in mind I started to play around with the data from Strava, a popular app for recording exercise. The data proved to both me extremely messy, and was predominantly .gpx, a data format I hadnâ€™t worked with before. Given my thoughts that visualising Strava usage over time might be interesting to not just myself but other strava users, I decided to make this into a Shiny app.&lt;/p&gt;
