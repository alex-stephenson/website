&lt;p&gt;As part of my dissertation I used network analysis and machine learning to analyse Russian misinformation on Twitter. I have split the research into three blog posts. This is the first one, where I examine currently theories of modern autocracy, specifically ‘Informational Autocracy’, by Guriev and Treisman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is a paper published by the European Centre for Climate, Energy and Resource Security. The aim of the paper is to compare the structures of Greenpeace and Extinction Rebellion in order to better understand how they influence the political process.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Using Shiny to Analyse Strava Data</title>

&lt;p&gt;Primarily I have worked with numeric and text data. I wanted to get to grips with working with different data sorts, and especially messy data. With this in mind I started to play around with the data from Strava, a popular app for recording exercise. The data proved to both me extremely messy, and was predominantly .gpx, a data format I hadn’t worked with before. Given my thoughts that visualising Strava usage over time might be interesting to not just myself but other strava users, I decided to make this into a Shiny app.&lt;/p&gt;
